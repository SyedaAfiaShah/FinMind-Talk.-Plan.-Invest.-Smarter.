# 💹 Next-Gen Portfolio Optimization: An AI-Driven and Cloud-Native Quantum-Enhanced Financial Decision-Making Framework  
### 🧭 Application Layer - FinMind: Talk. Plan. Invest. Smarter.

---

## Overview
This repository contains a working prototype of an **AI-driven, quantum-inspired portfolio optimization system** that merges **academic research** and **real-world application**.

The project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence**, **classical optimization**, and **quantum annealing principles** can be combined into a **unified investment decision pipeline**, deployed as a **cloud-native application**.

## Dual Nature of the Project

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Academic (FYP)** | Research framework exploring AI + quantum optimization integration. |
| **Application** | FinMind, a conversational + dashboard-based investment advisor built on the same core logic. |

**In essence:**  
FinMind = A research framework + a conversational AI layer + user-friendly dashboard.
